This project is a public database for physical activity recognition with smart phone. 5 activities, including walking, static, walking downstairs, walking upstairs and running have been recorded, accompanied with corresponding features extracted from the sensors embedded in the smartphone. The description of the features can be found in the pdf document "Identifying typical physical activity on smartphone with varying positions and orientations".
